HERO_PROMPT = """
Create a cinematic, wide-format hero image for a SaaS startup landing page.

Scene: A futuristic workspace where holographic data dashboards float in mid-air.
A diverse team of professionals collaborates around a glowing central display
showing upward-trending analytics charts. The environment blends a modern
glass office with subtle sci-fi elements — soft neon accent lighting in blue
and purple tones, clean lines, and a city skyline visible through floor-to-ceiling
windows in the background.

Style: Photorealistic with a slight cinematic color grade. Depth of field with
the foreground slightly blurred. Aspirational and premium feel — the kind of
image that makes you want to sign up immediately.

Mood: Innovation, collaboration, momentum, trust.
